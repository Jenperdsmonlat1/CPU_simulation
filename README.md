# CPU_simulation

## Introduction

This is a simple CPU simulation from the book fundamental of computer architecture and design by Ahmet Bindal. This is a simple project I sarted to learn hardware design and simulation with SystemC.

I'll make a VHDL version when I have the time.

To use it, you need to download and install the SystemC library.

## Compiling

To compile it, juste write the following command:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
