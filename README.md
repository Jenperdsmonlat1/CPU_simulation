# CPU_simulation

## Introduction

This is a simple CPU simulation from the book fundamental of computer architecture and design by Ahmet Bindal. This is a simple project I sarted to learn hardware design and simulation with SystemC.

At this time the only part I do are the program counter and the instruction memory.
